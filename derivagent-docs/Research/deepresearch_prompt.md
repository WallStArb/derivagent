# OpenAI DeepSearch Research Prompt: Advanced Option Strategies for AI-Powered Trading Platform

## RESEARCH OBJECTIVE
Research and analyze sophisticated option trading strategies that are ideal candidates for AI-powered automation, focusing on premium capture and time decay strategies with defined risk profiles. The goal is to identify strategies that are currently difficult to execute manually but would benefit significantly from artificial intelligence and automation.

## SPECIFIC RESEARCH FOCUS AREAS

### 1. Premium Capture & Time Decay Strategies
**Primary Focus:** Strategies that systematically capture option premium while benefiting from time decay (theta), similar to how major ETFs like JEPI and JEPQ operate.

**Key Strategies to Research:**
- **Multiple Entry Iron Condors (MEIC)** - detailed implementation, timing, and optimization
- **Iron Butterflies** - variations and advanced implementations
- **Condor spreads** (both call and put versions)
- **Calendar spreads** and diagonal spreads
- **Ratio spreads** and their applications
- **Short straddles and strangles** with protective elements
- **Covered call strategies** with systematic rolling
- **Cash-secured puts** with intelligent strike selection

### 2. Defined Risk Strategies Suitable for Automation
Research strategies that have:
- Clear maximum loss parameters
- Systematic entry and exit criteria
- Multiple decision points that benefit from AI optimization
- Complex timing requirements
- Multi-leg coordination challenges

### 3. Institutional-Grade Strategies
Analyze strategies currently used by:
- Covered call ETFs (JEPI, JEPQ, QYLD, etc.)
- Professional market makers
- Hedge funds specializing in volatility trading
- Systematic trading firms
